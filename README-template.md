## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - React Frontend tooling. is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects
- [Material-ui](https://mui.com/) - Material UI is a library of React UI components that implements Google's Material Design.

### What I learned

#### Grid 
The `Grid` in Material UI uses CSS's Flexible Box module for high flexibility. It consist of 12 columns which should be 
represented with integer values. It will be declared as follows
```tsx
<Grid container spacing={2}>
  <Grid item xs={8}>
    <Item>xs=8</Item>
  </Grid>
  <Grid item xs={4}>
    <Item>xs=4</Item>
  </Grid>
  <Grid item xs={4}>
    <Item>xs=4</Item>
  </Grid>
  <Grid item xs={8}>
    <Item>xs=8</Item>
  </Grid>
</Grid>
```
The parent is further labelled with `container`, while the children will have the `item`
